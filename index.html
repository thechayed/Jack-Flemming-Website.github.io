                        <p>Jack Fleming is a composer based in the UK.</p>
        
                        <p>Jack started his musical journey at age 7, learning the piano and music theory. He was accepted to study at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, and graduated in 2017, with a BMus (Hons).</p>
        
                        <p>Since 2020, Jack has actively worked within the film industry, both as a composer on numerous short films, and as a member of the music department on several high profile projects. He is heavily inspired by the work of John Williams, Gordy Haab, Bear McCreary, and Howard Shore, to name but a few.</p>
        
                        <p>When working on scores, and original music, Jack's main focus is on the narrative, and the emotions within the narrative, to help tell the story in the most emotional and human way possible.</p>

                            Jack is an absolute delight to work alongside. As part of my production for ‘From the Edge of the Clouds’, his
                            enthusiasm displayed for the project was beyond anything I could ask for, particularly in pre-production through
                            to post. Displaying dedication and attention to detail for every track, ensuring that the pieces created would fit
                            not only my characters but my story thematically, really brought the film together. Without his incredible work and
                            commitment, I truly believe the film would not have had the emotional effect I was reaching for and I advocate for
                            his incredible work not only as a composer but as a passionate and driven individual.
                        </p>

                        <p class="testimony">
                            Jack has worked on two of my films and has never let me down, taking on my briefs and creating some really
                            magical and emotional tracks. He also is not afraid of trying new things and seeing where it goes, having two
                            themes for my latest film, representing the two sides of the lead characters personality, which become a single
                            beautiful symphony at the end. Executed with precision and creativity.

                            The one and only composer I’ve ever worked with and I hope ever will work with. Spielberg has Williams, I have
                                Fleming.

                        <p class="testimony">
                            How would I describe Jack Fleming in three words, and why? He is resourceful, reliable and intuitive. His ability
                                to go above and beyond by connecting dots through sound and emotion is something that highlights how diligent
                                and determined he is to provide a unique style and sonic flavour for the spectator experience. He is reliable
                                through his passionate work ethic to keep producers and supervisors updated with deadlines and makes sure
                                that any genre and story isn’t above or below him. He is there for You. His intuitive ability to experiment and
                                discover new sounds also suggest how sympathetic Jack is to connecting with a scene and boosting it with the
                                Fleming touch.
                        </p>

                        <p class="testimony">
                            Collaborating with Jack was an integral part of my creative process; we shared thoughts and experimented with
                        new ideas – his suggestions also influenced some of my own making. He fully understood the piece and the kind
                        of sound needed for each section, and for an autobiographical show this is essential. The end result was
                        stunning, and I’m looking forward to taking this work, ‘And Here I Find Myself’ on a national tour this autumn
                        (2023).
